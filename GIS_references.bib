	abstract = {China’s Communist Party seized power in 1949 after a long period of guerrilla insurgency followed by full-scale war, but the Chinese revolution was just beginning. China Under Mao narrates the rise and fall of the Maoist revolutionary state from 1949 to 1976—an epoch of startling accomplishments and disastrous failures, steered by many forces but dominated above all by Mao Zedong.“Walder convincingly shows that the effect of Maoist inequalities still distorts China today...[It] will be a mind-opening book for many (and is a depressing reminder for others).”—Jonathan Mirsky, The Spectator“Andrew Walder’s account of Mao’s time in power is detailed, sophisticated and powerful...Walder takes on many pieces of conventional wisdom about Mao’s China and pulls them apart...What was it that led so much of China’s population to follow Mao’s orders, in effect to launch a civil war against his own party? There is still much more to understand about the bond between Mao and the wider population. As we try to understand that bond, there will be few better guides than Andrew Walder’s book. Sober, measured, meticulous in every deadly detail, it is an essential assessment of one of the world’s most important revolutions.”—Rana Mitter, Times Literary Supplement},

	abstract = {作者以論文著稱，此前幾乎無心于專著的寫作，認為只有論文才能最深刻的論證觀點，因此，不到評稱職之危急時刻，沒有著作出版。本書乃出版社專誠約稿，承蒙道炫老師應允，最終成書出版。可謂其至今最有分量的專著。      本書的特點是材料豐富扎實，倫理清晰，邏輯嚴密，以扎實的材料、嚴密的邏輯充分說明，中央蘇區後期反圍剿的失利，既有主觀的原因如左傾路線等的作用，更有客觀的因素，即力量對比的嚴重不平衡等。再者，革命發展也有一個逐步成熟的過程，革命策略、方針的有效與否並不與革命不革命直接相關。應該說作者的研究是嚴謹的，立論是平允的，對于推動中央蘇區研究的深入有積極的意義。      作者功底和本書的價值已被多位近代史專家聯手推薦︰王奇生、雷頤、馬勇等。},
